      <h1>Curator's Statement</h1>
      <p>The NativePark is my design for a contemporary museum park celebrating Native American culture. The museum
        features a combination of modern and contemporary pieces as well as more traditional pieces to represent that
        Native American culture isn't all just traditional and under the "noble savage" norm, and that there are many
        more aspects to it. The architecture of the museum's main structure reflects the design of both a campfire and a
        tipi, two significant and notable aspects of Native American culture. The modern glass design of the structure
        represents modernity and present-day society, and the changes and struggles many Natives are facing as they try
        to fit into society today.</p>
      <h2 style="font-size:25px; color:white;">Tipi Bag</h2>
      <p>Though not being a specific piece of art with a specific known artist, this traditional bag reflects upon the
        history of the Native Americans and the influence from the settlers that they were put under. I decided to use
        an anonymous artifact for the first exhibit because it represents the entirety of Natives as a whole. At the
        same time, this piece represents not only just a specific person or a group of people, but part of the history
        of our entire country.</p>
      <p>I decided to use "The Theft Outright" (Heid R. Erdrich) to represent this specific piece of art because both
        works show the influence of the American settlers upon the Natives. "The Theft Outright" explains the nature of
        Manifest Destiny, how white settlers believed that the land was destined to be theirs, eventually leading to
        them taking over Native land. The Tipi Bag shows that as the Americans began their expansion west, their
        influence reached the Natives as seen with the American flags on the bag.</p>
      <h2 style="font-size:25px; color:white;">Together</h2>
      <p><b>Daphne Odjig</b> was an Odawa-Potawatomi artist who was known for her pictographic style paintings. Her
        modern pieces focus on the importance of family, which is why I chose "My Father's Song" (Simon J. Ortiz) to
        represent this piece. This specific poem and piece both reflect on the love and bonding between family. It
        strays away from the idea of the "noble savage", showing that Native Americans are just like anyone else: loving
        and caring for each other, and that there isn't anything savage about them.</p>
      <h2 style="font-size:25px; color:white;">In-Appropriate #1</h2>
      <p><b>Frank Buffalo Hyde</b> is an Onondaga artist who is known for combining aspects of modern culture with
        Native American culture in his artwork. Many of his pieces, for example, "In-Appropriate #1", reflect on the
        issues of modern society and traditional Native American culture. This issue is also highlighted in the poem
        "Whereas My Eyes Land on the Shoreline" (Layli Long Soldier). Both pieces highlight the issue where modern
        society meets Native American traditions, and how modern-day people with Native heritage respond to this.</p>
      <h2 style="font-size:25px; color:white;">One November Morning</h2>
      <p><b>Brent Learned</b> is a Cheyenne-Arapaho artist who is known to paint in a more rustic and traditional style.
        I chose his work in the collection, "One November Morning", to highlight the violence that Native Americans
        face. Though the painting depicts a massacre during the period of Manifest Destiny, violence towards Native
        Americans occur to this day, as described in "American Arithmetic" (Natalie Diaz). As said by Diaz, Native
        Americans make up 19% of all police killings, which is higher than that of any other race. Connecting back to
        Learned's piece, it is shown that this violence has existed for a long time, and continues to exist without
        people paying much attention to the need to fix it.</p>
      <h2 style="font-size:25px; color:white;">enit</h2>
      <p><b>Wendy Red Star</b> is a contemporary Aps√°alooke artist known for her pieces featured in the Met, MoMA, and
        many other known museums around the world. Her piece "enit" is done in a style which I feel fits well with the
        idea of living one's life freely, which is why I connected this specific work to the poem "Advice to Myself"
        (Louise Erdrich). I decided to end off the museum collection with this specific exhibit to show that Native
        culture is not all traditions and how modern-society impacts a certain race, but can simply be the reflection of
        one's own life. The poem Advice to Myself teaches the important lesson to freely allow your life to shape your
        identity and not forcing your life in the way you want it to be.</p>
